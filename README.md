<p1> Lara Karacasu: I am a rising junior at Columbia's School of Engineering studying computer science! In my spare time, I love trying out new restaurants in NYC, spending time outdoors, and writing poetry. </p1>

<p1>Simon Ogundare: I'm a rising junior at Columbia College, majoring in Neuroscience and Behaviour. Outside of school, I play piano and jazz saxophone. I'm interested in data science for public interest because I'm interested in using data to share meaningful stories about particular underrepresented demographics. In the future, I'm looking to pursue an MD-PhD program in Neurobiology when I graduate!</p1>
